This are some of the assignments/tutorial work I have done in my first year. 

It may be incomplete due to data loss I experienced when I sent my laptop for fixing

During my first semester, I learnt basic Python, sorting algorithms like Selection and Insertion, and also some other algorithms
like Brute Force and Greedy

Second semester, I learnt about Abstract Data Types, and learnt how to make classes and instances.
