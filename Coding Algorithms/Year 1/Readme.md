This are some of the assignments/tutorial work I have done in my first year. 

It may be incomplete due to data loss I experienced when I sent my laptop for fixing

During my first semester, I learnt basic Python, sorting algorithms like Selection and Insertion, and also some other algorithms
like Brute Force and Greedy

Second semester, I learnt about Abstract Data Types, and learnt how to make classes and instances. Learnt more sorting algorithms
like bubble sort and other algorithms like Hash Tables, Linked list and Dynammic Programming
