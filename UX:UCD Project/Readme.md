This is was an UX/UCD group assignment assigned during my first year of university
We were tasked to design a high fidelity prototype of an application called DRIVE

However the Landing Page was a personal project and was designed by myself using Sketch.
I wanted to learn how to use the application and the project was a great way to do so.
